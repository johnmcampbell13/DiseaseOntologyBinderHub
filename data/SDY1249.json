    "brief_description": "Using whole tumor RNA-sequencing and mathematical deconvolution strategies to characterize low-grade glioma exosystem of several preclinical mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) optic glioma, a low-grade astrocytoma whose formation and maintenance requires productive interactions between non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells. The result demonstrate that optic gliomas generated by altering the germline Nf1 gene mutation, the glioma cell of origin, or the presence of co-existing genetic alterations represent molecularly-distinct tumors. However, these optic glioma tumors share a 25-gene core signature, not found in normal optic nerve, that is normalized by microglia inhibition (minocycline), but not conventional (carboplatin) or molecularly-targeted (rapamycin) chemotherapy. In addition, a genetic signature conferred by Pten reduction and corrected by PI3K inhibition was identified, which predicts progression-free survival in patients with either low-grade or high-grade glioma. Collectively, these findings support the concept that gliomas are composite ecological systems whose biology and response to therapy may be best defined by examining the tumor as a whole.",

    "hypothesis": "maintenance of low-grade optic gliomas in mice require a supportive tumor microenvironment containing microglia, which are attracted to the developing cancer by chemokines , and elaborate specific growth factors that promote neoplastic cell growth. These cellular interactions could be hypothesized to create a new homeostatic state, not present in the non-neoplastic optic nerve, and thus establish new circuitries and interdependencies for chemotherapeutic targeting",
