    "endpoints": "The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint of death-censored graft failure, clinically evident acute rejection, or strictly defined abnormalities of renal histology. The secondary endpoint is the change in GFR between 6 and 24 months post transplantation. We propose to correlate non invasive test results during the initial 6 months post transplant with renal function and biopsy results obtained at those two time points.",

    "hypothesis": "Comprehensive noninvasive monitoring approaches will detect subclinical graft injury and thereby have a strong association with short- and long-term outcome in renal allograft recipients and providing an additional assessment of risk.",

Each of the proposed noninvasive monitoring test results will be assessed individually and jointly for their discriminatory ability for outcomes.",
