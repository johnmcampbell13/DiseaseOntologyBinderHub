    "description": "Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as the birth of an infant before 37 weeks of gestational age. It is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 15 million preterm births per year. Vaginal microbiome more specifically is known to change throughout pregnancy, and can even affect the fetus before delivery. This study presents the first meta-analysis of vaginal microbiome in preterm birth. This study integrated raw 16S ribosomal RNA vaginal microbiome data from three pregnancy related studies consisting of over 300 pregnant patients sampled longitudinally over the three trimesters. It was found that women who later have a preterm delivery, have a higher variance in their vaginal microbiome, with the largest, most significant difference between term and preterm patients being in samples collected during the first trimester. While several of the microbial genera have been reported previously, three of those nine microbial genera are newly reported here. New hypotheses emerging from such an integrative analysis can lead to novel diagnostics to identify women who are at higher risk for PTB and potentially inform new therapeutic interventions.",
