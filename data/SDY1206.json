    "description": "Previous studies have shown that vaginal microbiota of asymptomatic, nonpregnant, reproductive age women cluster into 5 distinct ?community-state types?, which differ both by dominant <i>Lactobacillus</i> species as well as overall community composition. A much greater proportion of African-American and Hispanic women harbored a non-<i>Lactobacillus</i>-dominant community, suggesting that in some women a non-<i>Lactobacillus</i>-based vaginal community may be a normal variant. \nA recent study examined vaginal microbial composition and the risk for preterm birth but had very few African-American subjects and few preterm births. This study characterizes vaginal microbial community characteristics over time in a large predominantly African-American cohort of pregnant women and test whether particular community characteristics are associated with the risk for subsequent preterm birth.",
