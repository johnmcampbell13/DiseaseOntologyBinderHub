    "brief_description": "This data comes from peripheral blood from individuals that had a kidney transplantation. The study is a longitudinal study with data collected at time 0 (considered pre-transplant), 6 and 24 months after the transplant. They are classified in three clinical outcomes defined by pathology reads of serial allograft biopsies scored by Banff criteria and the chronic allograft damage index (CADI) score: Non progressors (NP; n=10) had low non incremental CADI score without acute rejection, progressors with no rejection (PNR; n=10) had incremental CADI score over 2 years without rejection, and progressors with rejection (PR; n=7) had incremental high CADI scores over 2 years with rejection episodes. This data reveal that the immune repertoire diversity of individuals that reject the organ is higher in comparison with those that did not reject the organ. Additionally, after 2 years of follow-up, patients who developed rejection show an overall reduction of B-celll diversity with persistence in and expansion of specific clones.",
