    "description": "Goal for the study was to identify NK cell ligands regulated by influenza A virus infection. More specifically we asked whether A/California/07/2009 or A/Victoria/361/2011 virus influenza A viruses differentially modulate NK cell ligands. Using 9 healthy Stanford blood bank donors, we isolated monocytes and NK cells. Monocytes were infected for 1 hr, followed by co-culture with NK cells for 6 or 23 hr hours. Brefeldin adn Monenin were added for the last 4 hours. They were then stained with a CyTOF panel and run on a Helios Mass cytometer. Two major ligands we found that contributed to the variance between the two strains were CD54 and CD112.",
