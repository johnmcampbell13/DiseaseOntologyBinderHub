    "hypothesis": "The immunologic response of malaria-naive adults to vaccination with adjuvanted RTS,S shows significant individual variation: some vaccine recipients are protected, and among those who are not protected, some exhibit a delay in the development of parasitemia [1, 3?7, 11]. Protection of malaria-naive volunteers is associated with both CSP-specific antibody and T cell responses. CSP-specific CD4+ T cells associated with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-_, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-_, and CD40L; anti-CSP immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels; and ex vivo CSP-specific IFN-_ enzyme-linked immunospots are observed in persons protected from malaria after challenge with infected mosquitoes [7, 12]. These immunologic markers approximate, but do not accurately predict, which of the vaccine recipients will be fully protected, will be unprotected, or will show a delay in disease onset.",
