Compare lymphocyte responses at Days 6-8 and the lymphocyte and serology responses at Day 28 post-immunization following administration of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. 2. Evaluate changes in cytokine profile in the immune response (CD4, CD8, gamma-delta cells, B cell responses) from Day 0 to Day 6-8 for T cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). 3. Evaluate changes in cytokine profile in the immune response (CD4, CD8, gamma-delta cells, B cell, and serology responses) from Day 0 to Day 28 for HAI responses. 4. Evaluate any potential gene expression signatures either at Day 0 or during the early response period Day 6-8 that are associated with immune senescence, potentially providing insight into mechanism. 5. Compare cell specific gene expression differences between age groups for both whole blood and whole PBMC. 6. Determine the effect of cell subset frequency variation on serum cytokine abundance. 7. Evaluate CMV and EBV seroreactivity at Day 0 and additional timepoints throughout the study as able.",
