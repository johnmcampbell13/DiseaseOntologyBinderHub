    "description": "Despite decades of attempts to link infectious agents to preterm birth, an exact causative microbe or community of microbes remains elusive. Culture-independent sequencing of vaginal bacterial communities demonstrates community characteristics are associated with preterm birth, although none are specific enough to apply clinically. Viruses are important components of the vaginal microbiome and have dynamic relationships with vaginal bacterial communities. The authors hypothesized that vaginal eukaryotic DNA viral communities either alone or in the context of bacterial communities are associated with preterm birth. In this nested case-control study, serial mid-vaginal swabs were obtained at routine prenatal visits and bacterial communities and eukaryotic viral communities were characterized from extracted DNA. Viral communities were analyzed according to presence/absence of viruses, diversity, dynamics over time, and association with bacterial community data obtained from the same specimens.",
