    "brief_description": "Gliomas are diverse neoplasms with multiple molecular subtypes. How tumor-initiating mutations relate to molecular subtypes as these tumors evolve during malignant progression remains unclear. We used genetically-engineered mouse models, histopathology, genetic lineage tracing, expression profiling, and copy number analyses to examine how genomic tumor diversity evolves during the course of malignant progression from low-to high-grade disease.",

    "hypothesis": "The genetic requirements during tumor progression from low- to high- grade and heterogenity gliomas can be achieved through genomic analysis on a series of inducible GEM models in oncogenic driver mutations. The GEM models with the similar genetic alterations as in the human gliomas could drive the similar malignant progression; CNA may be a consequence of Kras-G12D inducibe malignant progression; p53 deletion contributed to the difference between genomic landscapes in these models.",

We use this model system here to examine the genetic requirements for tumorigenesis within G1/S and MAPK pathways and the genomics of tumor evolution during progression from low- to high-grade disease, and validate subsequent hypothesis in other GEM models and human tumor xenografts in mouse.",
