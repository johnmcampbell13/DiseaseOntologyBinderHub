    "description": "Recent studies about association between maternal vaginal microbiota and risks for preterm birth (PTB) conflicted along similar lines: Caucasian and Asian women cohorts showed associations between PTB and low Lactobacillus vaginal communities (BV-like) while no significant association with PTB was detected in cohorts of African-American women. This study compares two new larger cohorts of women at low and high risk for PTB, addressing two challenges: (i) low power resulting from the combination of small study populations (30?91 pregnant women), the many taxa measured by metabarcoding, and the absence of initial hypotheses more specific than some difference between preterm and term gestations; and (ii) insufficient understanding of population-specific factors that might modulate the PTB?microbiota association.",
