We incorporate an analysis of naive, memory, and effector T cells with functional markers of homeostasis, activation, and tissue residence along with quantification of in situ turnover and TCR clonal distribution to reveal distinct patterns of compartmentalization, maintenance and proliferation of human T cells.",
