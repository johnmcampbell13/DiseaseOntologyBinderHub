    "brief_description": "Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with severe itching. People with atopic dermatitis have defects in the skin barrier as well as defects in the immune system which fights off skin infections. People who have atopic dermatitis often have complications from viral and bacterial skin infections, such as recurring Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), or Staph infections. The purpose of this study is to look at how defects in the skin barrier and immune response affect risk for skin infections. The study will compare the skin barrier and immune response of people with and without atopic dermatitis in relation to whether Staph bacteria is growing on their skin.",
