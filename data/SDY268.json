    "description": "NOTE:  only data provided here is from Fig. 15-16.  Abstract of entire study: Many successful vaccines induce persistent antibody responses that can last a lifetime. The mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear, but emerging evidence suggests that they activate dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll-like receptors (TLRs)1,2. For example, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful empiric vaccines ever developed3, activates DCs via multiple TLRs to stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines4,5. Triggering specific combinations of TLRs in DCs can induce synergistic production of cytokines6, which results in enhanced T cell responses, but its impact on antibody responses remain unknown. Learning the critical parameters of innate immunity that programs such antibody responses remains a major challenge in vaccinology. Here we demonstrate that immunization of mice with synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands 4 + 7 induces synergistic increases in antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with a single TLR ligand. Consistent with this there was enhanced persistence of germinal centers (GCs), and of plasma cell responses, which persisted in the lymph nodes for >1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no enhancement of the early short-lived plasma cell response, relative to that observed with single TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells, isolated 7 days after immunization, indicated early programming towards B cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as on T-cell help. Immunization protected completely against lethal avian and swine influenza virus strains in mice, and induced robust immunity against pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus macaques.
