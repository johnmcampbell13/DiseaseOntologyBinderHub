We generated a peptide microarray featuring tiled peptides with sequences derived from the hemagglutinin proteins of multiple influenza strains. We probed the microarrays with pre- and post-vaccination serum from each age group. Serum antibody reactivity to the microarray peptides was quantified using fluorescently labeled anti-human secondary antibodies and a fluorescent microarray scanner.",
