    "description": "The study's aim is to generate knockin (KI) mice expressing human TLR4 (huTLR4KI mice), human MD-2 (huMD-2KI mice) and both human TLR4 and MD-2 (TLR4/MD-2 KI mice) rather than the endogenous murine gene(s). The rationale is that differences in responses to non-enteric (variant) LPSs between humans and mice may limit the applicability of murine models as a means to 1) assess host responses to infection with organisms like Y. pestis, from which LPS triggers little response via human compared to murine TLR4/MD-2. 2) evaluate the safety and efficacy of purified/synthetic TLR4 ligand immunotherapeutics.  Initial characterization of KI mice was done to determination the safety of MPL, a purified TLR4 agonist, in TLR4/MD-2 KI mice compared to wildtype mice.  The study generated data to evaluate the ability of MPL (and for comparison a CpG TLR9 agonist) to enhance antibody and T cell responses and thus protective immunity induced by immunization of wildtype and TLR4/MD-2 KI mice with F1 plus V antigen from Y. pestis.",
