    "description": "<p>AVA000 is an ongoing 43-month prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled comparison of AVA administered either SQ or IM in up to 8 doses (licensed regimen) or as few as 4 doses. From inception the trial has been on schedule in enrolling 1,560 healthy adults (as of 07/2003, 1480 subjects) at 5 clinical sites in the US, randomized into six study groups with 260 per group.  Group 1 receives the licensed regimen (8 doses, SQ), and groups 2-5 receive 4-8 doses, IM. Group 6 receives placebo, either SQ or IM.</p><p>For immunogenicity analysis, blood samples are obtained from all subjects at enrollment, then prior to and 4 weeks after each injection (except at week 2). Levels of AbPA are measured in all subjects at all time points. A functional in vitro toxin (PA) neutralization assay is also performed on a subset of serum samples. For reactogenicity analysis, all adverse events, including local reactions at the injection sites, are actively monitored with both subject diaries and objective assessments by research study staff.</p>",
