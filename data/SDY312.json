Compare lymphocyte responses at Days 5-7 and the lymphocyte and serology responses at Day 28 post-immunization following administration of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. 2. Evaluate changes in cytokine profile in the immune response (CD4, CD8, gamma delta cells, B cell responses) from Day 0 to Day 5-7 for T cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). 3. Evaluate changes in cytokine profile in the immune response (CD4, CD8, gamma delta cells, B cell, and serology responses) from Day 0 to Day 28 for HAI responses. 4. Evaluate any potential gene expression signatures either at Day 0 or during the early response period Day 5-7 that are associated with immune senescence, potentially providing insight into mechanism. 5. Compare monocyte reactivity to activating stimuli at Days 0 and 5-7 with the lymphocyte and serology responses at Day 28 post-immunization following administration of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Year 1 only).
