    "description": "Despite the importance of the immune system in many diseases, there are currently no objective benchmarks of immunological health. In an effort to indentify benchmarks of immunological health, influenza vaccination was used in 30 young (20-30 years) and 59 older subjects (60 to 89 years) as models for strong and weak immune responses, respectively. Serological responses to influenza strains as well as a wide variety of other parameters, including gene expression, antibodies to hemagglutinin peptides, serum cytokines, cell subset phenotypes and in vitro cytokine stimulation were measured. Using machine learning, nine variables predicting antibody response with 84% accuracy were identified. Two of these variables are involved in apoptosis, which positively associated with the response to vaccination and was confirmed to be a contributor to vaccine responsiveness in mice. The identification of these biomarkers provides new insights into what immune features may be most important for immune health.",
