This study built on the separate but related RELIVE-02 retrospective study that assessed the effects of live lung donation on survival and short-term morbidity. This multicenter cross-sectional cohort study invited the RELIVE-02 living former live lung donors to undergo questionnaire and pulmonary function test assessments to further determine the long-term outcomes of live lung donation. This study used preoperative donor pulmonary function data and normative data to assist with assessing the effects of live lung donation on lung donors.",
