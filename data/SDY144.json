    "description": "The treatment of pediatric immune system dysfunctions depends upon the basic understanding of its molecular and cellular components, as well as the inherent relationships between these components. Specifically, such knowledge requires an appreciation of B-Iymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. Research investigating these cells and their functions necessitates the availability and acquisition of peripheral blood samples from healthy children to form control data groups against which various experimental conditions can be measured. Volunteers will be asked to donate blood samples to be used to further study the circulating dendritic cell subpopulations and establish their normal ranges. Blood samples will also be used to isolate antigen specific T lymphocytes, serve as a monocyte source and establish gene signatures. <br><br>The assay results from SDY144's EXP13603, EXP11769, and EXP13604 are the same as for this study.  The difference is how the floe cytometry results were analyzed in this study versus SDY144.",
