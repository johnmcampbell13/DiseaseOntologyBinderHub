    "description": "A genome wide association study was performed in a discovery set of samples obtained from 43,568 women of European ancestry using gestational duration as a continuous trait and term or preterm (<37 weeks) birth as a dichotomous outcome. Samples from three Nordic data sets (involving a total of 8643 women) were used to test for replication of genomic loci that had significant genome wide association (P<5.0?10?8) or an association with suggestive significance (P<1.0?10?6) in the discovery set. Four loci were associated significantly with gestational duration, and three showed association with preterm birth with genome wide significance. An analysis of mother?infant dyads suggested that these variants act at the level of the maternal genome. Data is shared at http://www.genestation.org/analysis/gwas/Zhang_2017/discovery",

    "hypothesis": "Variation in birth timing and in the risk of preterm birth arises from genetic factors that largely but not exclusively reside in the maternal genome. Preterm birth, and gestational duration in general, is a complicated phenotype that is affected by both maternal and fetal genomes.",
