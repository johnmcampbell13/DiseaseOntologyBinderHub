    "description": "For enrolled infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, structured interviews of the parents/guardians were performed by site investigators and clinical details were collected via emergency department and hospital inpatient chart reviews. Site teams collected both NS and NPA samples from infants within 24 hours of hospitalization. The composition of NS and NPA microbiota were characterized by sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 region on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Results indicated that there was considerable overlap between NS and NPA microbiota. Additionally, microbiota from both specimen types were associated with bronchiolitis severity.",

Bronchiolitis severity outcomes were defined as 1) intensive care use (i.e., admission to intensive care unit and/or use of continuous positive airway pressure and/or intubation during inpatient stay) and 2) hospital length-of-stay of 5 or more days.",
