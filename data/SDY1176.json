    "brief_description": "The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a panel of reproducible recombinant inbred mouse strains with high levels of standing genetic variation, thereby affording unprecedented opportunity to perform experiments in a small animal model containing controlled genetic diversity while allowing for genetic replicates. Here, we advance the utility of this unique mouse resource for immunology research, as it allows for both examination and genetic dissection of mechanisms behind adaptive immune states in mice with distinct and defined genetic makeups. This approach is founded on quantitative trait locus mapping: identifying genetically variant genome regions associated with phenotypic variance in traits-of-interest. Furthermore, the CC can be utilized for mouse model development; distinct strains have unique immunophenotypes and immune properties, making them suitable for research on particular diseases and infections. Here, we describe variation in cellular immune phenotypes across F1 crosses of CC strains, and reveal novel quantitative trait loci responsible for several immune phenotypes.",

    "hypothesis": "We hypothesize that the use of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a panel of reproducible recominant inbred mouse strains, can enhance immunology research by better modeling the phenotypic diversity in human T-cell immunity. Additionally, the CC model allows for quantitative trait locus mapping to reveal novel candidate genes linked to T-cell phenotypes.",

This initial proof-of-concept genetic mapping as well as our extensive dataset pave the way for future use of CC mice for genetic mapping of immune traits as well as targeted CC mouse strain selection for future immunology and immunogenetics studies.",
