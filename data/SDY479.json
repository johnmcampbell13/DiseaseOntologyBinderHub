The primary aims are : (1) To investigate whether the levels of mRNA encoding cytotoxic proteins perforin and granzyme B, and T cell marker CD3, are a sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic test for acute rejection in renal allografts; and (2) To determine whether mRNA profiles of sequential urine specimens predict the development of rejection. We will investigate whether mRNA profiles predict kidney graft function as assessed by estimated GFR at 12, 24 and 36 months after transplantation.",
