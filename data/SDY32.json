Serum samples were collected weekly from subgroup A and analyzed serum antibody response using ELISA, Toxin Neutralization Assays, and Surface Plasmon Resonance.  Also, brachial and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested from 3 of each group at 10 time points.  Lymph nodes from one side of each mouse were used for histology and nodes from the other side were used for phenotyping by flow cytometry.",
