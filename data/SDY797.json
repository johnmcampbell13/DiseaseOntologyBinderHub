If the destruction of the beta cells is stopped, the patients might be able to produce insulin on their own longer, which could stop or slow the progression of their type 1 diabetes.",

    "description": "T1DM is an autoimmune disease that can emerge suddenly, causing dependence on insulin for life. This means that the immune system (the part of your body that helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin (beta cells). As beta cells are destroyed, one's ability to produce insulin is decreased. Insulin helps keep blood glucose (sugar) levels normal.",
