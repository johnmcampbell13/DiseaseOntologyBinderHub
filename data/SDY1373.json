Reads were aligned to the human reference assembly (GRCh38.p7) using STAR software (v2.4.2a; option '--quantMode GeneCounts'). Gene annotation was obtained from Ensembl (release 79, ensemble.org). VOOM+Limma analysis (R software, version 3.2.2) was used to assess differential gene expression at each post-vaccination day (d1, d3 and d7) against baseline (d0). Next, we intergreted gene expression data and antibody response using an sPLS algorithm, in order to down-select genes correlating with multivariate antibody responses at days 28, 54, 84,180.",
