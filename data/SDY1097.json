    "description": "Knowledge of human immune responses during early life remains sparse, owing to the difficulty and impracticality of obtaining blood and tissue samples from infants. Our current view of normal infant immune responses, including T cell differentiation and function, is based mainly on the sampling of umbilical cord blood or fetal tissue, which reflect immune responses in utero but not responses to the diverse antigens encountered in early life. Fundamental information about the establishment of adaptive immunity during infancy, including how T cells respond, differentiate and populate tissue sites, remains undefined. Through collaboration with organ procurement agencies, we have established protocols for obtaining lymphoid and mucosal tissues from individual organ donors for whom consent has been given for the use of tissues for research.",
