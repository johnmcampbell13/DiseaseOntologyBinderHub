Blood samples will be collected on Days D0 (at enrollment) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D180 post vaccination to study innate and/or adaptive immunity markers. Even though influenza vaccination is considered safe, volunteers will be asked to report any local or systemic AEs from Day 0 (vaccination) to Day 7 in memory aids. Reactogenicity events will also be evaluated by injection site examination on visits at D0, D1, D3 and D7. Volunteers will be also asked to report local and systemic AEs developing the day of a blood draw.",
