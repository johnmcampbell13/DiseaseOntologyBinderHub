    "description": "Helicobacter pylori (HP) colonizes 50% of the world&rsquo;s population resulting in a decades-long gastric infection. Bacterial interaction with host intracellular environment occurs via injection of bacterial components through a TIVSS or intracellular replication. HP has been recognized for its ability to modulate intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLR). Host responses toward the bacterium can result in asymptomatic, pathogenic or even favorable immunity. Mechanisms underlying the dual role of HP as a commensal versus pathogen are not completely understood. We combined computational modeling, bioinformatics and experimental validation to investigate intracellular host-HP interactions. Global transcriptomic analysis on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in a gentamycin protection assay unveiled that intracellular colonization of HP upregulated NOD1, NOD2, NLRP3, NLRC5 and inflammasome components (Caspase-1 and -11) but suppressed regulatory NLRX1 which was inversely correlated to TRAF6, NF-B, proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Loss of NLRX1 facilitates bacterial clearance in BMDM and infected mice. Lastly, we constructed a computational model to shed light on complex immune responses and pathway crosstalk regulated by NLRX1 during infection. In conclusion, NLRX1 is associated with chronic bacterial persistence during H. pylori infection and it may represent an immune evasion mechanism employed by the bacterium to facilitate long-term host colonization.",
