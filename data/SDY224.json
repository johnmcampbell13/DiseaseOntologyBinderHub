Functional principal component analysis was used to examine time varying B cell vaccine response highlighting a single subject-specific mathematical pattern explaining ninety percent of the transcriptome variation. In addtition, daily sampling and monitoring of the proliferation marker Ki-67, revealed influenza-specific CD4 T cells do respond to vaccination.",
