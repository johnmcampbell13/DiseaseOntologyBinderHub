    "endpoints": "The primary endpoint for this protocol is the global DNA methylation patterns in PBMCs isolated from the persistent asthmatics and non-atopic healthy controls. The secondary endpoints are 1) Global DNA methylation patterns in nasal epithelial cells. 2) DNA methylation patterns in PBMCs isolated from the parent(s) and/or sibling for the determination of imprinting patterns. 3) Gene expression profiles of RNA extracted from PBMCs and nasal epithelial cells of the persistent asthmatics and non-atopic healthy controls.",

    "hypothesis": "That epigenetic marks are responsive to unique exposures in the inner city and that these exposure responsive epigenetic marks play a fundamental role in the etiology and severity of asthma in the inner city, provides a provocative new direction for asthma research that is mechanistically based, is likely to have important public health implications, and will establish novel insights into the inner city asthma phenotype.",

The secondary objectives are to obtain specimens that will enable us in future studies to determine 1) Whether epigenetic marks in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from asthmatics are also present in nasal epithelial cells. 2) Whether the epigenetic marks in the PBMCs are imprinted from the parental epigenome. 3) How the epigenetic marks affect gene expression.",
