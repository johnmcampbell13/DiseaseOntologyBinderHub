This Phase I study for individuals 18-45 years of age and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the past 3-48 months will be treated with Proleukin (subcutaneously) 3 times per week for 28 days and Rapamune (orally, daily) for 12 weeks.  The trial will test whether the combination of Proleukin and Rapamune can be safely administered and whether treatment halts the autoimmune destruction of remaining beta cells.",
