    "description": "This study will look for relationships among the immune responses induced by MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine. The study will also determine if the T cells that respond to different vaccine epitopes have correspondingly different functional profiles. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimen as well.",

    "hypothesis": "The MRKAd5/HIV vaccine received particular attention when the Step Study analysis revealed that certain vaccine subgroups with baseline Ad5 seropositivity exhibited increased HIV-1 acquisition rates, halting its further use in all HIV-1 vaccine trials involving Ad5 seropositive subjects. Although hypotheses have been generated that may explain vaccine-induced increased HIV-1 infection rates (3, 7, 8) and enhanced acquisition was recently recapitulated in the simian immunovirus (SIV) challenge model (9), no clear mechanisms have been identified to date.",
