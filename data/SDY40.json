We will focus separately on TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, that recognize viral targets, TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6 (bacterial targets), and the effects of aging on MIF.<br/><br/>We will quantify TLR expression as well as efficiency of signaling pathways triggered by TLR engagement to identify mechanisms that contribute to the impairments of innate immunity associated with aging and immunosuppression.<br/><br/>Finally, we will assess the functional and genetic polymorphisms of MIF in the innate response to TLR stimulation.",

    "description": "We will recruit adult (21-49 years of age), elderly (>50 years), ages as outlined in the RFA, or non-elderly but immunosuppressed (defined as taking at least 10 mg of prednisone daily for at least one month) participants from the Greater New Haven area and rheumatology clinics in the Yale-New Haven Healthcare System. Individuals of either gender and all ethnic groups will be eligible to participate.<br/><br/>We will stimulate monocytes and DCs in vitro with ligands of TLRs 1-9 and quantify the efficiency of stimulation by assessment of production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. TLRs 10 and 11 will not be addressed at this time as ligands are not known. Lineage specific pro-inflammatory cytokines from PBMCs by FACs. We will quantify intracellular levels of TNF&alpha; and IL-6 by FACS from PBMCs in suspension on the day of isolation of the cells. This is essential to control for differences in cell composition in PBMCs isolated from different individuals, given the broad range of hematopoietic cells synthesizing TNF&alpha; and IL-6.<br/><br/>By using multi-color staining of PBMCs with lineage-specific fluorescent antibodies, we will identify lineages positive for intracellular cytokine production at the single cell level, and track potential age-associated changes in cell lineages. Our experimental approach will be to obtain monocytes/macrophages cells from young adult and elderly subjects, define their Mif genotype, and analyze their baseline and stimulus-induced production of MIF.<br/><br/>Patient samples for genotyping will be obtained from the pellet of the Ficoll-hypaque isolation of PBMCs and extracted DNA will be analyzed for Mif genotype by established, robotic methodology that requires <1 &mu;g of DNA. Purified monocytes/macrophage will be studied for their baseline and stimulation-induced responses following protocols in place in our laboratory.",
