    "description": "The phenotype and intracellular signaling activities of all major innate and adaptive immune cells were simultaneously quantified in serial whole-blood samples throughout pregnancy. Three sets of data were generated by quantifying the abundances of peripheral immune cell sub-sets, capturing endogenous intracellular signaling activities, and determining the capacity of immune cell subsets to respond to stimulation with receptor-specific ligands. The csEN algorithm was adapted from the Elastic Net (EN) regularized regression method and accounts for the influence of previous biological knowledge of receptor-specific signal transduction on the generation of single-cell mass cytometry data. This algorithm allowed to infer a model of interrelated immune features that accurately predicts the timing of immunological adaptations over the entire course of a term pregnancy.",
