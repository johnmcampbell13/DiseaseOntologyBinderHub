    "description": "The CIT consortium conducted a total of 9 studies across North America (CIT02 through CIT08) and the Nordic region (CIT01). CIT08 was a long-term follow-up study for interested participants at the North American sites. The target population is individuals with type 1 diabetes, normal kidney function, and intractable hypoglycemia. All studies treated participants with up to 3 separate infusions of islets. Subjects in CIT07, a single arm Phase 3 license-enabling study, received induction and maintenance immunosuppression in an open-label fashion consisting of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; basiliximab instead of ATG for the 2nd and 3rd transplants, if applicable), etanercept, sirolimus and low-dose tacrolimus.",

    "endpoints": "CIT-07: The primary endpoint for this study is the proportion of subjects with an HbA1c <7.0% at Day 365 AND free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365 inclusive following the first islet transplant, with the day of transplant designated Day 0. The key secondary endpoints are the following: 1) The proportion of subjects with an HbA1c <7.0% at day 730 AND free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 730, inclusive, after the first islet transplant. 2) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <= 6.5% at one year after the first islet transplant AND free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365 after the first islet transplant. 3) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <= 6.5% at two years after the first islet transplant AND free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 730 after the first islet transplant. 4) The proportion of subjects free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365 after the first islet transplant. 5) The proportion of subjects free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 730 after the first islet transplant. 6) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7.0% at one year after the first islet transplant. 7) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7.0% at two years after the first islet transplant. 8) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <=6.5% at one year after the first islet transplant. 9) The proportion of subjects with HbA1c <=6.5% at two years after the first islet transplant. 10) The proportion of insulin-independent subjects at one year after the first islet transplant. 11) The proportion of insulin-independent subjects at two years after the first islet transplant. CIT-08: The primary endpoint is duration of sustained islet allograft function as determined by evidence from MMTT of c-peptide production at each anniversary of the final transplant. A c-peptide level greater than or equal to 0.3 ng/mL at 0, 60, or 90 minutes will be considered evidence of islet allograft function. The secondary endpoints include the following: 1) Serum creatinine and calculated eGFR at each annual study visit. 2) Incidence of serious adverse events during the 12-month period preceding each annual study visit. 3) Insulin requirements during a one-week period preceding each annual study visit. 4) Incidence of severe hypoglycemic events during the 12-month period preceding each annual study visit. 5) HbA1c levels at each annual study visit. 6) All causes of mortality. 6) Presence of alloantibody after graft failure, in the absence of immunosuppression.",
