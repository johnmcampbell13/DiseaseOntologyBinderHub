    "hypothesis": "The primary endpoint of the entire AMP Lupus Network Project is a three-level categorical variable describing responder status where responses will be divided into three categories using the ACCESS trial response definitions for complete response (CR) (UPCR <0.5, creatinine normal or, if abnormal, no greater than 125% of baseline; no outcome based upon urinary sediment; steroid taper required), partial response (PR) (>50% reduction in UPCR without meeting UPCR criterion for CR), and non- response (NR) (<50% improvement in UPCR and/or failure to meet serum creatinine criteria). Patients meeting CR, PR, and NR criteria will be compared to each other for distinct signatures. It may be that for Phase I activities analyses will need to focus on responders (CR + PR) versus non-responders.",
