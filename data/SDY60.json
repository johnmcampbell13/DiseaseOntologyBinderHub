This analysis should allow us to define repertoire characteristics that degrade with age and correlate these changes with possible influenza exposure and vaccination.  2. Measure the nascent and developing memory T cell repertoires against influenza in 35 children ages 3 to 16 who will be followed longitudinally for a minimum of three years. 3. Measure the nascent and developing memory T cell repertoires against influenza in children ages 3 to 16 with JRA who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. 4. Model the effect of immunosuppression on memory repertoire formation using normal and autoimmune HLA transgenic mice.",
