    "description": "We present human T cell responses in multiple sites including blood, lymphoid, mucosal and secretory tissues of 20 CMV seropositive donors. Overall, CMV-specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, either predominant in blood, bone marrow (BM) and lung, or lymph nodes (LN) with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues. Together, our results reveal tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control, with global effects on T cell homeostasis over the human lifespan.",
