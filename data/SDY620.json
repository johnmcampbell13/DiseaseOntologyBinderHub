    "brief_description": "Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with severe itching. People who have atopic dermatitis often have complications from skin infections; these can include eczema herpeticum after herpes simplex virus infection or eczema vaccinatum after smallpox vaccination. People with atopic dermatitis may suffer from skin infections and may therefore respond differently to vaccinations.",

A secondary objective is to compare the immune response of AD participants receiving intradermal influenza vaccination to the response of AD participants receiving intramuscular influenza vaccination.",
