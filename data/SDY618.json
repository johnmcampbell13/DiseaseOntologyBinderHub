    "brief_description": "A new flu vaccine which is injected into the skin instead of into the muscle has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for vaccination of the general population including patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This new vaccine has been shown to work as well as the vaccine which is injected into muscle when tested in people without atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of the study is to estimate the variance of the log fold change from baseline in HAI antibody titers for non-atopic controls and participants with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), following administration of a single dose of the seasonal 2011-2012 Fluzone Intradermal vaccine.",
