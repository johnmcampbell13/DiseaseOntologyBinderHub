This will be done by determining the rate of related adverse events and serious adverse events in the course of treatment. Secondary Objective: 1) To determine whether a 6-month treatment with cockroach SCIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, will induce a 3-fold increase in cockroach-specific serum IgE. 2) To determine whether a 6-month treatment with cockroach SCIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, will induce changes in the serum levels of cockroach-specific IgG4. 3) To determine whether serum from cockroach SCIT-treated participants can inhibit the in-vitro cockroach antigen binding to B-cells after 6-month treatment with cockroach SCIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses. 4) To determine whether a 6-month treatment with cockroach SCIT, using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, will induce suppression of in vitro peripheral blood basophil and other cell activation by cockroach allergenic extract.",
