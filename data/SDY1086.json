    "description": "Single center, open mechanistic study in which subjects will be randomized to receive IIV per label at day 4 of a 5 day course of a specific antibiotic regimen (Group A) or IIV alone (Group B). Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening (from D -21 to D -1), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/- 1 day), D30 (+/- 5 days), D90 (+/-14 days), D180 (+-/14 days), D365 (+/-28 days) post vaccination for both groups to study innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Stool samples will be collected in both groups at screening (from D - 21 to D -1), on vaccination (D0), D1, D3, D7 (+/- 1 day) and D30 (+/- 5 days), D90 (+/-14 days), D180 (+/-14 days), D365 (+/- 28 days) to study the gut microbiome in both groups. For Group A, additional visit on D-6 to D-3 will occur with stool and blood samples collection. Study will be conducted outside the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 influenza seasons.Antibiotics received by Group A will be started 3 days prior to vaccination (D-3) and continued on day of vaccination (D0) and for one day after vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days a) Flagyl 500 mg po tid b) Vancocin 125 mg po qid c) Neomycin sulfate  500mg po tid. The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each antibiotic. The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram positive, and gram negative bacteria); has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the regimen (Vancocin and Neomycin sulfate ); and part of the regimen is used to treat Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin and Flagyl). Subjects in Group A are asked to avoid all ethanol and any ethanol- containing drugs while taking antibiotics and for 48h before and after taking the antibiotics.",

The status of the intestinal microbiome may impact the immune responses to vaccinations and alter functional protective immunity in humans. Here we hypothesize that the changes in the fecal microbiome induced by antibiotics translates into suboptimal Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI) titers.",
