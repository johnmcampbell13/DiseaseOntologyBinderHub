The first part is a cross sectional comparison of perceived barriers to adherence to post-transplant immunosuppressant regimens in parents of children (0-11 years) versus adolescents (12-21 years). The second is a longitudinal study to evaluate whether perceived barriers to adherence increase with time during the first year following transplantation.",

    "endpoints": "1. Perceived barriers to adherence in adolescents (12-21 years of age) and parent/legal guardian of pediatric (0-11 years of age) at any time post-transplant using BMQ, PMBS and AMBS questionnaires. 2. Change in perceived barriers to adherence from baseline (1-3 months) to follow-up (9-12 months) using BMQ, PMBS and AMBS questionnaires.",
    "gender_included": "Female, Male",
    "hypothesis": "The hypotheses to be tested in this study are: 1. Adolescents (age 12-21) after solid organ transplantation (SOT) will perceive greater barriers to medical adherence to post-transplant treatment regimens than younger SOT recipients (11 years or younger). 2. Perceived barriers to adherence to post-transplant SOT treatment regimens will increase as time from transplant increases.",
