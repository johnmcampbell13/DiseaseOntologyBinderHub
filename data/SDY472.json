Volunteers will be assigned into one of three vaccine groups (intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV); live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV- given year 1 only) or intradermal TIV, based on the type of study vaccine they received in 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013. All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned seasonal influenza vaccine. Volunteers will complete 3 study visits at Day 0, Day 6-8 and Day 24-32.",
