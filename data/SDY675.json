    "description": "The adaptive immune systems capability to protect the body requires a highly diverse lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoire. However, the influence of individual genetic and epigenetic differences on these repertoires is frequently underestimated. By leveraging the unique characteristics of B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets isolated from monozygotic twins, we have elucidated the impact of heritable factors on the V(D)J recombination process and have shown that the repertoires of both naive and antigen experienced cells are subject to biases resulting from initial recombination differences. Moreover, we show that the relative usage of V and J gene segments is chromosomally biased, with approximately 1.5 times as many rearrangements originating from a single chromosome. These data refine our understanding of the heritable mechanisms affecting the repertoire, and show that bias exists on a chromosome-wide level.",
