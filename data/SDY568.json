    "description": "This study will evaluate whether IBC-VSO1 vaccine, a synthetic metabolically inactive form of insulin designed to prevent pancreatic beta-cell destruction, protects against autoimmune attack in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients.  Halting beta-cell destruction may result in a prolonged remission and subsequent delay in diabetes related complications.  Patients in this study must have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes no more than 3 months prior to study enrollment.",
