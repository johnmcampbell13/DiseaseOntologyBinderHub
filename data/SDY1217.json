    "brief_description": "Mechanistic study of why elevated tumor suppressor ARF expression in aggressive subtypes of Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is associated with poor outcome and attenuated response to chemotherapy (cisplatin).  The study was investigated In both GEMM and murine xenograft models of human MIBC.  Resistance was mediated in part by the integrin-binding protein ITGB3BP (CENPR) and reflected ARF-dependent impairment of protein translation, which was exaggerated by drug treatment.",
