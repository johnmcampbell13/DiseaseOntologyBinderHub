The secondary objectives included evaluation of whether VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP (at doses 1 mg and 4 mg) induced antibodies as assessed by an HAI assay at Day 0 and Week 12.  Exploratory analyses included evaluation of the immunogenicity of VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP at doses 1 mg and 4 mg using intracellular cytokine staining, ELISpot, neutralizing antibody assay, HAI assay to H1 or H3HA or other immunological assays at time intervals between Day 0 and Week 42.",
