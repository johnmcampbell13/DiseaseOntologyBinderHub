Household or close contacts of research subjects will be invited to join in a surveillance portion of the protocol in order to obtain safety information on the transmission and severity of RG-HRV16 colds.",

    "objectives": "HRV16 (Family Picornaviridae Genus Rhinovirus type 16) has been used extensively to induce colds in studies of experimentally inoculated volunteers that are designed to study the pathogenesis of colds and effects of antiviral medications.  Historically, source virus is generated using viruses isolated from nasal secretions.  It is impossible to ensure that nasal secretions that are chosen for isolation of \"\"seed virus\"\" contain only the pathogen of interest.  This problem is minimized through the use of virus derived from a cDNA clone that was produced in E. coli.  Second, RNA viruses, such as HRV, mutate as the virus grows because their RNA polymerases have no error-correcting function. The cDNA clone, reproduced by the much more accurate E. coli DNA polymerase, provides a stable source of virus sequence for production of future inocula.",
