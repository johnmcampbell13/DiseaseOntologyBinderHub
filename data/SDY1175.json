    "brief_description": "Sequence data from cell free DNA found in 1351 blood samples collected from 188 patient was analyzed and assembled. 3761 of the 7190 larger contiguous regions generated were novel, with little or no homology to existing sequencing data. Presence of coding sequences in the contigs was confirmed in independent experiments and by direct PCR. The organisms identified represent entirely novel taxa, showing a substantially broader diversity in the human microbiome than previously appreciated.",

    "description": "Cell-free DNA-derived microbiomes of 1,351 samples from 188 patients in four longitudinally sampled cohorts were analyzed. The majority of assembled sequences from cfDNA are derived from previously unidentified organisms, for instance numerous novel anelloviruses in immunocompromised patients, which represent a doubling of identified members in that viral family. Over two thirds of the sequences are bacterial, and the majority are most similar to proteobacteria; however, many large contigs can only be classified at the phylum or superkingdom level. Numerous novel phages were also found throughout the population. Multiple independent analyses confirm the existence of these novel sequences.",
