    "brief_description": "Natural Killer (NK) cells play critical roles in immune defense and reproduction, yet remain the most poorly understood lymphocyte population. Because their activation is controlled by a variety of combinatorially expressed activating and inhibitory receptors, NK cell diversity and function are closely linked. To provide an unprecedented understanding of NK cell repertoire diversity, we used mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze 35 parameters, including 28 NK cell receptors, on peripheral blood NK cells from five sets of monozygotic twins and twelve unrelated donors of defined HLA and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype. This analysis revealed a remarkable degree of NK cell diversity, with an estimated 6,000-30,000 phenotypic populations within an individual and >100,000 phenotypes in this population. Genetics largely determined inhibitory receptor expression, whereas activation receptor expression was heavily environmentally influenced. Therefore, NK cells may maintain self-tolerance through strictly regulated expression of inhibitory receptors, while using adaptable expression patterns of activating and costimulatory receptors to respond to pathogens and tumors. These findings further suggest the possibility that discrete NK cell subpopulations could be harnessed for immunotherapeutic strategies in the settings of infection, reproduction, and transplantation",

This study revealed >100,000 phenotypes of Nk cells across 22 healthy adult donors.

Staining of cells was all performed ex vivo on cropreserved PBMC from healthy, unrelated human donors. We also had an arm of this study to measure these same 28 receptors in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins. Access to these samples allowed us to determine which receptors were under stronger genetic regulation and which markers were influenced more from environment.",
