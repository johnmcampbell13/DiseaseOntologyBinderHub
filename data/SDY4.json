    "brief_description": "Atopic Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is a skin disease that causes the skin to be hot, dry and scaly, and have severe itching. There are different kinds of eczema. Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a type of eczema that spreads due to an underlying herpes virus infection. The purpose of this research study is to identify the risk factors that may cause EH.",

    "description": "DETAILED_DESCRIPTION<p><body><p>AD is characterized by skin inflammation and recurrent skin infections. In addition, people with AD may have a severe and sometimes fatal reaction to the smallpox vaccine called EV. KLH is a carrier protein that can be used to deliver antibodies to the body. However KLH itself, may cause an immune response.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to determine the body's reaction to pure KLH in people without AD. This will be used to establish a baseline immune response and may be compared to the immune response in people with AD during future studies.</p><p>This study will last 8 weeks and will have 11 study visits. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. All participants will receive their immunizations at Visits 5 and 6.</p><ul><li>Participants in Arm 1 will receive 2 immunizations each with 100 &mu;g of KLH each.</li><li>Participants in Arm 2 will receive 2 immunizations through scarification (a shallow cut in the skin) with jabs, each containing 20 mg/mL of KLH. Adverse reactions will be monitored after each immunization. Once safety data from these 2 groups have been reviewed, the next 2 groups will be enrolled.</li><li>Participants in Arm 3 will receive 2 immunizations each with 250 &mu;g of KLH each.</li><li>Participants in Arm 4 will receive 2 immunizations through scarification with 15 jabs, each containing 20mg/mL of KLH.

    "hypothesis": "The hypothesis of the present project postulates that AD subjects who develop EH differ from other AD subjects and healthy volunteers at the level of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs in the blood and skin.  This study should provide for the first time information on whether myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs of subjects with EH differ: 1. Qualitatively, quantitatively, and phenotypically. 2. Functionally at the level of DC-related cytokines and their interferon-producing capacity and interaction with T-cell subtypes after stimulation with viral stimuli; and the cytokine production of T-cells, B7 molecules, and factors involved in innate immunity. 3. At the level of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of structures involved in the viral entry on myeloid and plasmacytoid DC subtypes in the blood and the skin of these subject subgroups. Based on the knowledge acquired herein, it should be possible to identify differences in DC subtypes in the blood and the skin of AD subjects in response to viral stimuli that will finally enable us to define AD subjects at risk for EH.",
