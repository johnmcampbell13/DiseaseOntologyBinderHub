    "endpoints": "Mice will be weighed and scored daily for mortality and morbidity and the presence of diarrhea and other symptoms. Animals judged to be in a moribund state will be euthanized and tissue samples will be collected. Mice are expected to become visibly ill at day 2 or 3 post-infection. Tissues will be collected at days 4, 7, and 10 post-infection and processed for cell immunophenotyping and bacterial loads.",

    "hypothesis": "We have previously reported novel evidence supporting a role of T cells in modulating host responses to C. difficile. Specifically, T cell alteration towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype due to lack of PPARgamma resulted in increased disease symptoms and colonic pathology, which correlated with the abrogation of T cell regulatory (Treg) responses and shift towards a Th17-driven cellular response. To better understand the role of T cells during C. difficile infection from initiation through expansion to resolution, we built computational model of the cellular host response to the bacterium.",
