    "endpoints": "The primary endpoint is change in eGFR (MDRD in the adult cohort and Schwartz method in the pediatric cohort) from 6 months to 5 years post-transplantation. The following secondary endpoints will be measured: 1. Patient survival as assessed by the incidence of death reported in the first 5 years posttransplant. 2. Graft survival as assessed by the incidence of graft loss reported in the first 5 years posttransplant. 3. Renal function as assessed by the absolute GFR at 5 years post-transplant. 4. Change in Chronic Kidney Disease stages between transplant and 5 years posttransplant.",
