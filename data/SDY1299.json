    "brief_description": "Gene expression analysis of RA and OA synovial tissue revealed 3 distinct synovial subtypes.  These labels were used to generate a histologic scoring algorithm in which the histologic scores were found to be associated with parameters of systemic inflammation, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP levels, and autoantibody levels.  Comparison of gene expression patterns to clinical features revealed a potentially clinically important distinction: mechanisms of pain may differ in patients with different synovial subtypes.",
