We sorted 4 samples (comprising 100's of PB of each of 3-4 TR subsets and are analyzing the initial antibody repertoires.  As additional sequences become available, we will use bioinformatics to generate phylogenetic trees of the antibody repertoires from each individual and compare the antibody repertoires of plasmablasts with defined distinct TR signatures to the pool of total IgA-PBs within a given patient sample.",
