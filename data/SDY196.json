    "description": "Influenza is an important pathogen in the United States, with approximately 20,000 deaths per year, mainly among elderly people or those with underlying medical conditions that increase susceptibility to complications from the disease. In addition, considerable morbidity is associated with influenza with a significant impact in productivity in the workplace and home. Influenza has the potential for much more serious consequences as demonstrated by the appearance of four world-wide pandemics in the last century.  In principle, serious influenza outbreaks can be prevented by vaccination. However, vaccination is complicated by two features: First, the influenza virus undergoes frequent mutations in the genes encoding the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), leading to the need to reformulate the vaccine every year. Second, the appearance of the rapidity with which influenza infections can spread. Thus, influenza holds significant potential as a bioterrorism agent. Lupus patients have an increased risk of infection and mount lower responses to vaccinations. The objectives of this study will use genetic, cellular and humoral techniques to identify and explain abnormalities in the immune response to influenza vaccination in lupus patients. The results will clarify vaccine effectiveness among affected patients, increase the understanding of immune dysregulation in lupus, and aid in establishing guidelines for the effective vaccination of lupus patients. The benefits to the subjects are not direct; however, information gained may improve responses of reducing or preventing influenza among the affected population. Additionally, with an increased understanding of the processes of lupus, targets for disease intervention or strategies for treatment may appear.",
