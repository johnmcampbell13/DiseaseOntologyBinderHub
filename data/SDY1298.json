    "brief_description": "As a master regulator of chromatin function, the lysine methyltransferase EZH2 orchestrates transcriptional silencing of developmental gene networks. Overexpression of EZH2 is commonly observed in human epithelial cancers. Overexpression of EZH2 is commonly observed in human epithelial cancers. The paper demonstrated the causal role of EZH2 overexpression in NSCLC with humEZH2 in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, which featured distinct transcription program from KRAS- and EGFR models. To target EZH2-dependent cancers, the lab designed an open-source EZH2 inhibitor JQEZ5 and shown antitumor efficacy in preclinical studies in EZH2-driven models.",
