    "endpoints": "Primary endpoints: Correlation (and prediction) of signatures of innate immunity and plasmablasts with influenza antibody titers at 1 month after vaccination across multiple seasons. Association of these signatures with the longevity of the response. Integrative analysis of microRNAs and transcriptomic profiling to reveal potential regulators of vaccine immunity. Secondary endpoints: Comparisons between the in vivo response of young and elderly individuals (HAI, plasmablasts). Analysis of the composition of the peripheral B cell pool in young and elderly individuals. Comparison between antibody class switch recombination and in vitro antibody production between young and elderly individuals.",
